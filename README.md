Meet Protium Protium is a web-development platform that encourages 
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. With Protium you can 
take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. 
It takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on 
writing your project without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
Core idea Main Protiumâ€™s strength is modules. Every project built with Protium contains modules 
like news module, auth module, etc. Because every module works with other modules only through Protium. 
That provides extreme flexibility. Protium supports JVM languages: Java, Groovy, Kotlin and JRuby. 
Itself was written on Java. Ridiculously fast Protium was designed to help developers 
take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible. Increasing speed Reuse 
already written modules like user authentication, content administration, site maps, 
Database connectors, CSRF, Template engine, and many more.
# In other words
Just new java web framework
